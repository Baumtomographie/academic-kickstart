To assess the safety of roadside trees or as part of ecophysiological research it is often important to investigate the spatial distribution and development of tree roots. Conventionally this is done by laborious excavations or by the application of root drills which in many cases do not allow a comprehensive data collection. An indirect method for the investigation of subsurface features is ground penetrating radar (GPR). Its ability to detect tree roots has been shown by several studies. Another geophysical method which has been successful applied to study different aspects of tree roots is electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). These former studies by other authors mainly concentrated on a correlation between the measured parameters (signal amplitude and resistivity) and root-biomass on forest sites or controlled conditions. But this method may also be useful for anthropogenic influenced areas. We have been using both techniques to study the spatial root architecture of urban trees. This research is designed to elicit the possibilities and limitations of the methods in urban areas. Reference sites have been established to quantify the methodsâ€™ resolution and assess possible fields of application. These test site measurements are the basis for the interpretation of results at urban tree sites. Their results highlight the importance of 3D-measurements in urban areas because in inhomogeneous soil other reflectors (like rocks, cables, pipes, etc.) cause similar signals and bear a risk of misinterpretation. This can be minimized if detected objects have a spatial continuation and are connected to a tree.
