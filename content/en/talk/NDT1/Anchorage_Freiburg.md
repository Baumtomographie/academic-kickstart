# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "For risk assessment of trees in forests and urban areas an estimate of anchorage may be required. To this end, the results of non-destructive static load tests have been used for more than 20 years. Data of applied bending moments and root plate inclination are extrapolated to the point of failure in at least three ways. However, almost no studies have been published comparing estimated failure loads to measured ones. Here, we present results of almost 200 trees pulled to failure, and evaluate the accuray of non-destructive estimates."

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Academic's *Slides* feature and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further talk details can easily be added to this page using *Markdown* and $\rm \LaTeX$ math code.
