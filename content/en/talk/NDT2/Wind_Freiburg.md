# Abstract. What's your talk about?
abstract = "To date, the anchorage and wind load of urban trees can only be assessed in static load tests. These are complex and expensive, and the reliability of wind load estimates have been questioned. Monitoring the basal inclination of trees in natural winds yields a wind tipping curve, which can be used to inexpensively assess anchorage. Combining this with static load test allows to estimate real wind loads, which can be used to assess the conventionally used wind load estimates. We present results from a range of urban trees and evaluate this new method."

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Academic's *Slides* feature and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further talk details can easily be added to this page using *Markdown* and $\rm \LaTeX$ math code.
