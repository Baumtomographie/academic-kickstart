We measured size and form of 78 branches collected in four *Aesculus hippocastanum* L. and one *Aesculus x carnea* Hayne. The slenderness coefficient of a branch varied depending on the method used to measure it. Thus, the method applied in a specific case, e.g. where exactly the basal diameter was measured, must be documented precisely. 87 % of all branches were critically dangerous according to VTA. A criterion, which identifies almost all branches in every tree as "dangerous" is not useful for hazard tree assessment.
