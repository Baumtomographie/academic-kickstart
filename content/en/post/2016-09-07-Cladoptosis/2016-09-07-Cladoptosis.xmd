Why do oak trees throw twigs away? Often people assume it's a sign of drought stress or ageing. Some years ago, I studied this phenomenon in a research project.

Most twigs are shed in autumn, when photosynthesis has ceased and drought is not an issue any more.

Most shed twigs are one year old and leafless. Their shedding does not reduce transpiring leaf area.

# Conclusions

Twig abscission (cladoptosis) is no immediate reaction to drought stress. 

Most twigs are shed by vigourously growing trees, so it is not a sign of ageing either.
