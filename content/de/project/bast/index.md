Since more than a decade, young roadside trees throughout
Germany have shown bark damages of unknown causes. Aims of the project
were a representative survey of the damage and the development of
management recommendations to prevent damage. 

App. 6 % of the surveyed
trees were damaged. 73 percent of trees did not have bark protection,
but the percentage of trees with bark protection has increased greatly
in recent years. Stem protection paint reduced the damage percentage by 79 percent, reed wraps by 64 percent.  Maple
(Acer spp.) is the genus with by far the most damage-prone tree
species. An influence of wood or bark structure on the development of
damage can be negated. The two most frequently planted varieties of
Norway maple, *A. platanoides* `Emerald Queen` und `Farlakes Green`,
showed a higher degree of damage than the other varieties of this
species.

None of the examined climatic parameters had an influence on the rate of damaged trees on any given site.
This indicates that the extreme conditions, which very probably initiate or cause this type of stem damage,
can occur at any site within the first few years after planting. Therefore, it is recommended to employ
preventive measures when planting roadside trees, preferably protective paints or reed mats. In order to
reduce drought stress, roadside trees should be planted on sites with sufficient rooting space and provided
with enough water. Since slant increases the danger of damage, correct planting and stabilization of young
trees should ensure they stay perpendicular.
The employment of protective stem paint or reed mats should be incorporated into important German
guidelines on planting roadside trees: Hinweise zur Stra√üenbepflanzung in bebauten Gebieten (FGSV
2006) (suggestions for planting roadside trees in urban areas), and
RAS-LP4 (FGSV 1999) (guidelines for road building; part 4: landscaping: protection of trees, existing vegetation and animals during construction
work).
