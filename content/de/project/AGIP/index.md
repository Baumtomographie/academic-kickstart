summary = "To assess the safety of roadside trees or as part of ecophysiological research it is often important to investigate the
spatial distribution and development of tree roots. Conventionally this is done by laborious excavations or by the
application of root drills which in many cases do not allow a comprehensive data collection.
An indirect method for the investigation of subsurface features is ground penetrating radar (GPR). Its ability to
detect tree roots has been shown by several studies. Another geophysical method which has been successful applied to study different aspects of tree roots
is electrical resistivity tomography (ERT). These former studies
by other authors mainly concentrated on a correlation between the measured parameters (signal amplitude and
resistivity) and root-biomass on forest sites or controlled conditions. But this method may also be useful for anthropogenic influenced areas.
We have been using both techniques to study the spatial root
architecture of urban trees. This research is designed to elicit the possibilities and limitations of the methods in
urban areas. Reference sites have been established to quantify the methods’ resolution and assess possible fields
of application. These test site measurements are the basis for the interpretation of results at urban tree sites.
Their results highlight the importance of 3D-measurements in urban areas because in inhomogeneous soil other
reflectors (like rocks, cables, pipes, etc.) cause similar signals and bear a risk of misinterpretation. This can be
minimized if detected objects have a spatial continuation and are connected to a tree."

Since more than a decade, young roadside trees throughout
Germany have shown bark damages of unknown causes. Aims of the project
were a representative survey of the damage and the development of
management recommendations to prevent damage. 

App. 6 % of the surveyed
trees were damaged. 73 percent of trees did not have bark protection,
but the percentage of trees with bark protection has increased greatly
in recent years. Stem protection paint reduced the damage percentage by 79 percent, reed wraps by 64 percent.  Maple
(Acer spp.) is the genus with by far the most damage-prone tree
species. An influence of wood or bark structure on the development of
damage can be negated. The two most frequently planted varieties of
Norway maple, *A. platanoides* `Emerald Queen` und `Farlakes Green`,
showed a higher degree of damage than the other varieties of this
species.

None of the examined climatic parameters had an influence on the rate of damaged trees on any given site.
This indicates that the extreme conditions, which very probably initiate or cause this type of stem damage,
can occur at any site within the first few years after planting. Therefore, it is recommended to employ
preventive measures when planting roadside trees, preferably protective paints or reed mats. In order to
reduce drought stress, roadside trees should be planted on sites with sufficient rooting space and provided
with enough water. Since slant increases the danger of damage, correct planting and stabilization of young
trees should ensure they stay perpendicular.
The employment of protective stem paint or reed mats should be incorporated into important German
guidelines on planting roadside trees: Hinweise zur Straßenbepflanzung in bebauten Gebieten (FGSV
2006) (suggestions for planting roadside trees in urban areas), and
RAS-LP4 (FGSV 1999) (guidelines for road building; part 4: landscaping: protection of trees, existing vegetation and animals during construction
work).
